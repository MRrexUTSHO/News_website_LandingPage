                                    <h1>Doctor Doom</h1>
                                    <p>Doctor Doom (Dr. Victor Von Doom) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
                                         Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The Fantastic Four #5 (July 1962). 
                                         In his comic book appearances, Doctor Doom is depicted as the monarch of the nation of Latveria whose goal
                                          is to bring order to humanity through world conquest. He serves as the archenemy of Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four, 
                                          though he has also come into conflict with other superheroes in the Marvel Universe, including Spider-Man, Iron Man,
                                           Doctor Strange, the Black Panther, the X-Men, and the Avengers. While usually portrayed as a villain,
                                         Doom has also been an antihero at times, working with heroes if their goals align and only if it benefits him.
